#MaTeX

MaTeX is a new formatting syntax and software tool that allows you to convert HTML file to clear and easy-to-read document. MaTeX offers modules to make it easy to display mathematical notation and highlight important information - such as rules, theorems, or definitions.

MaTeX is used in HTML file, so you can begin using it immediately in most popular browsers and some iOS applications.
